Forage Software Engineering Virtual Internship

Overview
Welcome to the Forage Software Engineering Virtual Internship! This program offers you the opportunity to gain practical experience in software engineering through a series of tasks that simulate real-world challenges. By completing these tasks, you'll develop key skills in data structures, software design, database management, and software integration.

Objectives
Understand and implement core data structures.
Learn how to design software systems using UML and ER diagrams.
Gain experience with database integration and querying using SQLite.
Enhance problem-solving and coding skills through practical assignments.
Program Structure
The internship consists of four main tasks, each focusing on a critical area of software engineering:

Task 1: Heap Data Structure
Objective: Learn and implement the heap data structure.
Description: In this task, you'll explore how heaps work and implement them in a programming language of your choice. You'll understand concepts like heap properties, insertion, deletion, and heapify operations.
Task 2: UML Diagram
Objective: Design a UML class diagram for a given system.
Description: You'll create a UML class diagram to model a software system based on a given set of requirements. This task helps you grasp object-oriented design and how to visualize system components and their relationships.
Task 3: ER Diagram
Objective: Design an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram for a database.
Description: In this task, you'll design an ER diagram to model a database system. You'll identify entities, relationships, and attributes, and learn how to represent these concepts visually to create a clear database schema.
Task 4: SQLite Repository Integration and Querying
Objective: Connect an existing repository to SQLite and create queries.
Description: For the final task, you'll integrate an existing repository with an SQLite database. You'll write and execute SQL queries to interact with the data, demonstrating your ability to work with databases in a practical setting.
Tools and Technologies
Throughout this internship, you'll work with various tools and technologies that are commonly used in the software engineering industry:

Programming Languages: Python,  Java.
Database: SQLite
Diagramming Tools: Lucidchart for UML and ER diagrams.
Version Control: Git and GitHub
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): VS Code, Jupyter Notebook.
